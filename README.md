# ACI Programmability

The code samples in these labs all leverage Python as the programming language. In order to run the exercises and code, you'll need to meet the following requirements.


Pro Tip: Always use a Virtual Environment to avoid version conflicts between your system scripts and ACI projects.


:$ python3 -m venv aci-env 
:$ source aci-env/bin/activate 

(aci-env):$ 

(aci-env):$ sudo apt update 
(aci-env):$ sudo apt install python-is-python3
(aci-env):$ pip install acitoolkit
